# graph-implementation
This repo contains C++ implementation of an undirected graph. I have also given solutions to some problems involving a graph

Classes
GraphNode - This is implementation of a node in a graph. A GraphNode object contains its name and its edges
Graph - Graph is just a collection of GraphNode objects (std::vector)
File(s): Graph.h, Graph.cpp
The file TestGraph.cpp contains some example using the Graph class object

I have used MS Visual Code to develop and test this on Windows. It should be possible to use this repo on other platforms like Linux as-is or with some minor modification
